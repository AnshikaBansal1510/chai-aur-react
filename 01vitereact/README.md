# React Setup and Implementations

## React Implementations
React provides two primary implementations based on the platform:
- **react-dom** → Used for building web applications.
- **react-native** → Used for building mobile applications (iOS & Android).

## Creating a React App (Using Create React App)
1. Run the following command to create a new React project:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app <project-name>
   cd <project-name>
   npm install
   npm run start

## Scripts Overview:
**start** → Runs the project in the development environment.
**build** → Prepares and optimizes the project for production deployment.

## Creating a React App (Using Vite)
1. Run the following command to create a new React project:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   cd <project-name>
   npm install
   npm run dev

## Notes
Scripts play an essential role in running and building your project.
Development mode (start/dev) is optimized for local development.
Production build (build) generates an optimized version for deployment.
